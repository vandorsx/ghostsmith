# ghostsmith

A barebones CLI tool for saving custom generated Ghostty icons to file.

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), a cross-platform terminal emulator, allows for [user-specified customization](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#macos-icon) to its macOS app icon. While incredibly cool and unique, because customized icons are compiled and applied at runtime, they're lost on application quit — ghostsmith is for the very small subset of users who might be bothered by this.

ghostsmith enables you to generate the same customized icon and apply it in a more persistent manner, using a tool like [Pictogram](https://pictogramapp.com) or the [native method](https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/08/change-mac-icons/).

The logic for generating an icon is largely ripped from Ghostty's source code, allowing for identical icons—as configured in Ghostty—to be generated.[^1]

[^1]: Theoretically. Report any issues if this is not the case.

## Using the ghostsmith CLI

1. Compile ghostsmith or download the pre-compiled [latest release](https://github.com/vandorsx/ghostsmith/releases/latest).
   1. To compile, an up-to-date version of Xcode should be used.
   2. The pre-compiled release is unsigned.[^2]
2. Run ghostsmith with the required arguments.

Upon running ghostsmith, your custom icon will be saved to the current working directory as `custom-icon.png`, or applied directly to the application when using the `--apply` flag.

### Available arguments

`--apply` sets the application icon directly, instead of saving it to the current working directory

`--screen-color` accepts a comma separated list of 1 or more hex color values and/or defined colors\
*(ex. `--screen-color "black,#ff9dfa"`)*

`--ghost-color` accepts a hex color value and/or defined color\
*(ex. `--ghost-color X11Purple`)*

`--frame` accepts one of the following options: `aluminum`, `beige`, `plastic`, `chrome`
\

The list of defined colors can be found [here](https://github.com/vandorsx/ghostsmith/blob/main/src/assets/rgb.txt).
