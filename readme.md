# ghostsmith

A barebones CLI tool for generating (and saving) custom Ghostty icons.

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), a cross-platform terminal emulator, allows for user-specified customization to its macOS app icon. While incredibly cool and unique, because the icon is compiled and applied at runtime, the customized icon is lost on application quit.

ghostsmith enables you to genereate the same customized icon and apply it in a more robust manner â€” using a tool like [Pictogram](https://pictogramapp.com) or the [native method](https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/08/change-mac-icons/).

The logic for generating an icon is ripped from Ghostty's source code, meaning it's possible to generate identical icons as configured in Ghostty.[^1]

[^1]: Theoretically. Report any issues if this is not the case.

   1. To compile, an up-to-date version of Xcode is required.
